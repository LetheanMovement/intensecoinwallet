Description: cryptocoin GUI for Lethean network - wallet and client
 Full Lethean client is a full-node wallet for the Lethean network.
 .
 Lethean (LTHN) is an open-source cryptocurrency
 that provides blockchain backed, distributed VPN services.
 Lethean uses a public ledger to record transactions
 while new units are created through a process called mining.
 Lethean aims to improve on existing cryptocurrency design
 by obscuring sender, recipient and amount of every transaction made
 as well as making the mining process more egalitarian.
 .
 This package provides the Lethean Qt-based GUI wallet.
 It includes both cryptocurrency and VPN management tools.
 If you plan to use the GUI, this is the only package you should
 install. For the proxy version, please also install the related
 browser extension from its store.
